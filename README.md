# Monitoring Tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Windows Exporter)

This repository demonstrates how to set up a monitoring stack using **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, **Loki**, **Promtail**, and **Windows Exporter**.  
It‚Äôs a local demo of the same architecture I use in workplace environments to monitor applications and servers.

No sensitive company data or configurations are included. The steps, however, reflect how the stack works in real-world setups.
